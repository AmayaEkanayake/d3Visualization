# D3.js Data Visualization Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises focused on learning D3.js for web-based data visualization. Each exercise builds upon the previous ones, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate directories for each exercise:

- **4.1 Draw SVGs**: Creating basic SVG shapes and understanding the coordinate system
- **4.2 Manipulate Elements**: Using D3 to change and add elements to a webpage
- **4.3 D3 Setup**: Setting up a responsive SVG container for visualizations
- **4.4 Load Data**: Loading and formatting data from CSV files
- **4.5 Binding and Drawing**: Binding data to DOM elements and drawing bars
- **4.6 Scaling Charts**: Making charts adaptable to different screen sizes
- **4.7 Adding Labels**: Enhancing charts with labels and text

## How to Use

Each directory contains:
- An `index.html` file that you can open in a browser
- JavaScript files with D3.js code
- CSV data files (where applicable)
- A detailed README.md with explanation and instructions

To run any exercise:
1. Navigate to the exercise directory
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
3. Examine the code to understand how the visualization is implemented

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

## Learning Pathway

These exercises provide a structured learning path for D3.js:

1. Start with understanding SVG basics
2. Learn to manipulate DOM elements with D3
3. Progress to loading and visualizing data
4. Develop responsive and well-labeled visualizations

Each exercise includes detailed explanations to help understand the concepts and techniques involved.
